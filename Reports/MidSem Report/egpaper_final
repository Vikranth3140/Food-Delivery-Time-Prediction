\section{Motivation}
Running a food delivery service comes with the challenge of keeping customers happy by delivering their meals on time and in condition despite hurdles like traffic or bad weather which can throw off the schedule unpredictably.

In order to address this issue effectively we are working on a Food Delivery Time Prediction System that utilizes machine learning methods. Our goal is to predict delivery times with precision by examining delivery data, current traffic situations and real time weather trends.

\section{Literature Survey}
% \subsection{Related work - Research Papers}
1. \textbf{DergiPark - Comparative Analysis of ML models}: It explores machine learning models for predicting food delivery times. The study highlights temperature, traffic, and courier background as important factors and suggests future work incorporating additional features.

2. \textbf{DergiPark - Application of Random Forest algorithm}: It analyzes online food ordering data to predict food delivery status using the Random Forest algorithm. It also suggests that traffic conditions have minimal impact on delivery timing, likely due to the use of single-person vehicles. \textcolor{blue}{\href{https://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/forecasting/issue/60291/842180}{Link}}

\section{Individual Tasks}
- \textbf{Vikranth Udandarao}: Data collection, preprocessing, and analysis. Implementation of machine learning models.

- \textbf{Swara Parekh}: Data collection, preprocessing, and analysis. Implementation of machine learning models.

- \textbf{Mohammad Ayaan}: Evaluation of machine learning models. Optimization based on performance metrics.

\section{Final Outcome}
The final outcome will be a Food Delivery Time Prediction system accessible using a Command Line Interface. It will predict the estimated delivery time for users based on various factors such as distance, restaurant preparation time, traffic conditions, and order details. The system will utilize machine learning algorithms like regression models to improve prediction accuracy. The project will include a detailed report and presentation showcasing the methodology, models, evaluation results, and the final integrated system.
